### IBM Watson Package 


In order to run this lab we need to import two packages.
+ IBM Watson: which allows access to the Watson Visual Recognition API
+ OpenCV: a package that will help us with image processing


The code below will install Watson Developer Cloud and OpenCV.


To run, click on the code cell below and press "shift + enter".

NOTE - The Watson Developer Cloud Package has been deprecated and has been replaced by the IBM Watson Package
